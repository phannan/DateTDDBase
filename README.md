# DateTDDBase
TDD Kata Starting Point for Junior Project

Note: I'm a C++ programmer. I am a good programmer, so I can pick up other languages fast. AND, I may not be following all standard practice for C#. If you see something that is weird for C#, then send me a polite email. If you are a student you can get some extra credit.

## TDD Tasks
Note: This is a lot more then we can do in one class. Do these in order.

Write a function that returns true or false depending on whether its input integer is a leap year or not.

+ A leap year is defined as one that is divisible by 4, but is not otherwise divisible by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.  
+ For example, 2001 is a typical common year and 1996 is a typical leap year, whereas 1900 is an atypical common year and 2000 is an atypical leap year.

Write a function that determines if a date is valid.  September, April, June, November have 30 days.  February has 28 days if not a leap year and 29 if a leap year and March, May, August, October, July, December, January have 31 Days.

Write a function that adds n days to the current date.  n can be positive or negative.

### Round 1

+ Create Function returns True or False Based on Whether it’s a Leap Year.
+ Have a strategy discussion among the three of you.
+ Ping Pong until Function tested and complete
+ Raise Hand to let me know you are done.
+ Continue Pairing on follow up Tasks until I bring you back.
+ Group Retro.

### Round 2
+ One person in the group swap into another group.
+ Have a strategy / state of the union discussion.  
+ 15 minutes of TDD ping-pong pairing
+ Group Retro
